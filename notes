Next steps:

- Scale ground using advice rather than creating a mesh to be the building
you're standing on.
- Make image a mask for emissives.

- Procedurally generate buildings.

- Work on building exterior image.

To Do Schedule:

Better invaders
	blender2 make all three alien shapes
	blender3 make legs move

	1 have something to do to start

End game

Attacks
	8 your bullets are green emissive
	9 invaders fire on you in white emissive (with end game)
	10 invaders damage you, 3 hits = end game


Spawn index 3 location (both negative)
compose a transform:
	- Rotation is same, no change
	- location x and y is average of locations?
	- z is minus arbitrary amount to make it flush with floor
	- x scale is based on index 0's x
	- y scale is based on index 0's y
